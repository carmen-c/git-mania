Question 1: During this linear process, where Dev B changed the document after Dev A had already committed and pushed their change to the remote (github), what extra step(s) could Developer B have taken to completely avoid this merge conflict?
Dev B could have pulled from origin before making any changes.
Branch off and delay the merge at a later time.

Question 2: Given your answer in Q1, does this mean that merge conflicts can be completely (always) avoided in the real world? Why or why not?
No,
